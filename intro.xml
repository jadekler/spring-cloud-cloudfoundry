<simpara>Spring Cloud for Cloudfoundry makes it easy to run
<link xlink:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud">Spring Cloud</link> apps in
<link xlink:href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry">Cloud Foundry</link> (the Platform as a
Service). Cloud Foundry has the notion of a "service", which is
middlware that you "bind" to an app, essentially providing it with an
environment variable containing credentials (e.g. the location and
username to use for the service).</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>spring-cloud-cloudfoundry-web</literal> project provides basic support for
some enhanced features of webapps in Cloud Foundry: binding
automatically to single-sign-on services and optionally enabling
sticky routing for discovery.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>spring-cloud-cloudfoundry-discovery</literal> project provides an
implementation of Spring Cloud Commons <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> so you can
<literal>@EnableDiscoveryClient</literal> and provide your credentials as
<literal>spring.cloud.cloudfoundry.discovery.[email,password]</literal> and then you
can use the <literal>DiscoveryClient</literal> directly or via a <literal>LoadBalancerClient</literal>
(also <literal>*.url</literal> if you are not connecting to [Pivotal Web
Services](<link xlink:href="https://run.pivotal.io)">https://run.pivotal.io)</link>).</simpara>
